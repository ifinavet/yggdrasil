# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Yggdrasil project! 🎉  
We are excited that you are interested in contributing.  
To maintain quality and consistency, we ask that **all contributions follow the guidelines below**.

---

## 📚 Language Requirement
- **All issues, pull requests (PRs), commits, and documentation must be written in English.**
- This ensures accessibility and understanding for all contributors and maintainers.

---

## 🔀 Pull Requests (PRs)

When opening a pull request, please ensure:

1. **Documentation**  
   - Every PR must include proper documentation for any new feature, bug fix, or update.  
   - If a feature affects user or developer usage, update the relevant `README.md` or docs folder.  

2. **Testing**  
   - All code must be tested.  
   - If tests are missing or cannot be created, the contributor must explicitly state the reason in the PR description (`Why no tests?` section).  

3. **Clarity**  
   - PR title and description should clearly explain:  
     - What was changed  
     - Why the change was made  
     - How it was tested  

4. **Conventions**  
   - Follow the repository's coding style.  
   - Reference related issues when applicable (e.g., `Closes #123`).

## 🐛 Issues

When creating an issue, please ensure:

1. **Documentation**  
   - Use English.  
   - Provide a clear and descriptive title.  
   - Explain the problem or suggestion in detail.  

2. **Reproducibility**  
   - If it is a bug, include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.  
   - Include environment details (OS, version, dependencies).  

3. **Labels**  
   - Assign appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).  

---

## 🚨 Enforcement

- **If any contribution (issue or PR) violates the requirements above, it will be closed or denied.**  
- Maintainers may request changes; if updates are not provided within a reasonable time, the contribution may be closed.  
- Repeated violations may lead to being blocked from contributing.

---

## ✅ Workflow Summary

1. **Create an issue** for what you want to fix. Wait until the issue is approved before creating a PR.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix (`feature/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug`)  
3. **Add documentation** for all changes  
4. **Write tests** (or declare reasons for missing tests)  
5. **Open a PR in English** with a clear description  
6. **Link issues** if applicable  
7. **Wait for review & make requested updates**
