## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20 or later)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ifinavet/yggdrasil.git
    cd yggdrasil/apps/midgard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the `midgard` directory and add the necessary environment variables. Look at the .env.example to get an idea of what you need.

   *Unfortunately our setup requires that you have an clerk account. Without it the auth won't work. We are assesing the options to move to a new solution but as of now you need to use clerk*

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
